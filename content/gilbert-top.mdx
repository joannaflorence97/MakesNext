The Gilbert Top by Helen’s Closet has been on my to-make list for aaaaages and I finally got around to it!
If you're looking for a relaxed, slightly retro button-up shirt, this might just be your new wardrobe staple. Here’s my full review, including sizing tips, construction notes, and whether I’ll make it again.

# Ease of Instructions

The instructions for the Gilbert Top are some of the clearest I’ve followed which is classic Helen’s Closet style (I've also made the Winslow Culottes). Each step is broken down with helpful illustrations, making even slightly more advanced techniques like the camp collar feel approachable. I think confident beginners would feel totally supported, and intermediate sewists will appreciate how smoothly everything comes together.

# Sizing and Fit

The Gilbert Top offers a beautifully relaxed fit with thoughtful drafting, including B and D cup sizing, which ensures better shaping right from the start
When I converted it into a sleeveless version, I relied on Helen’s dedicated blog post. Her instructions clearly guided me to adjust the shoulder seam, armscye depth, and shoulder slope to achieve a clean, well-fitted look.
The result? A breezy, sleeveless Gilbert that looks and fits beautifully, all thanks to Helen’s clear pattern hack guidance.

# Final Thoughts

The Gilbert Top is one of those patterns that feels endlessly wearable and equally satisfying to sew. Whether you’re making the classic version or hacking it into a sleeveless summer top like I did, the fit is flattering, the instructions are excellent, and the style is versatile enough to dress up or down. It’s the kind of pattern you’ll reach for again and again... and I already know I’ll be making more.

# Key Points

1. Easy-to-follow instructions (classic Helen’s Closet!)
2. Camp collar construction felt really intuitive
3. Fit is relaxed but not shapeless. I love the retro feel!
4. The tie front adds such a fun detail - I’ve already worn mine loads

This pattern is Billie by [Tilly and the Buttons](https://www.instagram.com/tillybuttons) and can be used to make a jumper as well as a jumper dress, with either regular or balloon sleeves. I chose to make the dress and chose the regular sleeve option!

I love this dress, it is so perfect and comfortable, just like I wanted! It a great ultimate work from home dress and looks much more professional than PJs! I love it paired with leggings for ultimate comfort. For a less casual look I pair this dress with tights and combat books as pictured. Did I mention it has pockets!? They're a great size and fit my big phone in them! They don't make the dress look super bulky like some other patterns do.

I'd recommend this pattern for confident beginners who are looking to get into sewing stretch fabrics for the first time, or to improve their abilities with stretch. I remember being terrified of sewing with stretch fabric before I started but you just have to go for it! There will be plenty of mistakes (trust me!) but it's so worth it in the end. I love not having to worry so much about getting the fit 100% right like you have to do with woven fabric because stretch fabric is very forgiving.

This awesome constellation fabric was bought from [Pound Fabrics](https://poundfabrics.co.uk/) and is a soft French Terry. Unfortunately, it's sold out now. Fortunately, I bought 7 metres of it so I have plenty left over! I'm thinking of making some Stella jogging bottoms with the remnants.

I'm already planning my next Billie!

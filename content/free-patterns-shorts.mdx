Sewing is an expensive hobby! Sometimes there are very high costs involved in buying fabric, tools, threads and of course a sewing machine. I like to grab a freebie where I can! That’s why today I’m sharing 7 different shorts sewing patterns that you can make for summer ☀️ These all come with free downloadable PDF patterns and instructions 💝

I’ve picked several different short patterns that all have unique features including front fly zips, elasticated waistbands and skorts. Most are for women but there is also a pattern for kids that is perfect if you like sewing children’s clothes! Most of these patterns are perfect for beginners but there is also a couple of patterns thrown in for beginners that are looking to level up their sewing skills.

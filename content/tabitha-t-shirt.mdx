I\'ve been wanting to try out a [Tilly and the Buttons](https://www.instagram.com/tillybuttons) pattern for a while now. I'm constantly looking at their Instagram page, and loving how aesthetically pleasing it is! I love how they cater to all skill levels and I refer to their blog and Youtube channel frequently because of how clearly everything is explained.

I got the "Make it Simple" Tilly and the Buttons book for my birthday recently and immediately went through the book sticking post-it flags on the pages of the patterns I wanted to try first. Learning to properly sew with stretch fabrics has been a goal of mine for a while, so when I saw that the book had an easy T-shirt pattern I knew that I had to try it. T-shirts are an absolute wardrobe staple and because I'm working from home at the moment due to Covid, they are what I wear almost every day.

The pattern is made up of a front and back bodice that are cut on the fold, plus a neckband. The instructions are incredibly clear, with a picture at each step.

The book also shows you how you can customise your T-shirt further by adding cuffs or an iron-on design! This is something I'll probably try soon!

The fabric used is from [Pound Fabrics](https://poundfabrics.co.uk/) and is a plain black cotton jersey. The neckband used was cut from the main fabric of a secondhand top that didn't fit me properly. The trickiest part of this pattern was adding in the neckband, which took 3 attempts. The neckband was such stretchy fabric so I had to keep chopping bits off of it to make it fit properly.

Overall, a lovely and quick pattern. I've just ordered some more stretch fabric with this pattern in mind!

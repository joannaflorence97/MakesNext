Happy New Year! :star2:

The beginning of a new year is a great time to reflect on how we'd like the next 365 days (or so) to go for ourselves; what we'd like to achieve and ways to reach these goals! I've decided this year to set myself a few sewing resolutions (reSEWlutions if you will!) so I can spend more time creating things that I love and getting the most out of my hobby!

## 1. Use fabric from my stash

I'm definitely not a hoarder but if there's one thing I collect a lot of, it's fabric. I have metres and metres of all types of fabric from poplin to satin, stretch velvet to French terry. There is absolutely no need for me to buying new fabric unless I have fully planned out a specific project and am at the point where I am ready to cut it out!

Benefits:

- I will get lots of shelving space in my cupboard back.
- I will save potentially hundreds of £££!
- It's more eco-friendly.

## 2. Take it slow

Once I've cut out a pattern and the fabric I tend to rush through the rest of the process. This year I'd like to take more time over things. I can imagine that this is probably a more enjoyable way of sewing, and in the long term this will probably lead to better made garments. Due to my busy lifestyle I'm also one who fits in 5 minutes of sewing around other tasks I have to do. I'd like to set aside time specifically for sewing so I can enjoy it stress-free for an hour or two, with a nice cup of tea and without having to think about anything else.

Benefits:

- Better quality garments.
- Less stress.
- More enjoyment!

## 3. Plan out projects before starting

In 2021 I had projects that I spent hours on, that ended up un-wearable or in my scrap pile due to poor planning. Not only is it a waste of time and fabric when this happens but it's extremely disappointing :weary:. I've bought a bullet journal and have vowed to myself that before I start anything I'll be drawing out diagrams, cutting out swatches and writing thoughts, ideas and things to remember throughout.

Benefits:

- Less wasted fabric.
- Less wasted time.
- Better results.

## 4. Do a wardrobe audit

I'd love to fill some gaps in my wardrobe and make more garments that I'll wear on a daily basis. For example, as I'm currently working from home I spend most of my life in comfy joggers and I definitely don't have enough of them. At the other end of the spectrum, I have quite a few items that don't fit me properly or I'm never going to wear again. I plan to donate these to charity, or give them a new life as clothes that I'll wear. I already have some transformation plans and I can't wait to bring my ideas to life!

Benefits:

- More space in my wardrobe.
- Sustainable sewing.

I think that's enough for me! I wish you a happy and healthy 2022 :gift_heart: :tada:

What are some of your sewing reSEWlutions? Below are a list that might spark some ideas for you!

1. Cut into that expensive fabric that you've been saving forever!
2. Regularly clean the insides of your sewing machine and/or overlocker.
3. Organise your fabric stash by colour, fabric type or any other way that works for you.
4. Get comfortable with a new type of fabric like satin or knits.
5. If you're used to sewing just one type of garment, try something compeltely different!
6. De-stash if you have fabric or patterns that you think you'll never use.
7. Learn how to use a new sewing foot such as a rolled hem foot.
8. Master a new technique such as sewing a zip fly or gathers.
9. Tidy up your sewing room and organise everything beautifully.

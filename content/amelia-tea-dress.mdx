# This is a h1

Not only is this 50\'s inspired vintage tea dress absolutely beautiful but the shirred waist and fluttery sleeves make it super comfortable and perfect for the summer.

The fabric used was from the sale at [Pound Fabrics](https://poundfabrics.co.uk/) and is a lightweight polyester. It was easy and enjoyable to sew with (after I realised that some of my pins were ruining it so I stopped using them!).

The pattern was easy to follow although I found that there were a few small steps not included such as adding understitching to the neckline facing as well as how to neatly finish seams. I overlocked edges as I went and gave a rolled hem to the skirt for a nice finish.

I didn't have to make any adjustments; the shirred waist makes it easy to get a flawless fit. However, I did add some hacks to this pattern. Firstly, I added some big pockets attached not only at the side seam, but also at the waist.

As the pattern calls for 60" fabric and the fabric I was using was 45" I also shortened the skirt length so I was able to still get a full circle skirt out of the fabric.

Overall, I absolutely loved making this pattern and it turned out great. I'll definitely be making it again with some more lightweight fabric for a great vintage-feel summer dress.

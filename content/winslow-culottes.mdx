The Winslow Culottes are a beginner-friendly pattern by [Helen's Closet](https://helensclosetpatterns.com/), featuring box pleats and an invisible zipper at the back. This is the first pattern that I’ve bought from Helen’s Closet and I have to say that I am super impressed. The pattern comes with four different length options. The one I chose to sew is view A (the shortest) but I’m definitely going to make some more in longer lengths.

The instructions were comprehensive, clear and beautifully formatted with excellent diagrams to follow. I had never printed and put together a large PDF pattern but it was easier than anticipated. I loved that the layers feature in Adobe Reader had been used so that there was an option to show just your size on the pattern pieces. This made cutting out the pattern after printing very clear and definitely helps to minimise mistakes.

The fabric used is from [Pound Fabrics](https://poundfabrics.co.uk/) and is a lightweight polyester that I bought a while back with the idea of practicing pattern matching. I think I did okay... although I still don’t feel entirely confident and definitely need more practice! I’m not sure the tartan was a great choice for the pattern... They’re a bit too bold for me to wear and because of this I’m not sure that they’ll get worn much (at least out of the house!). I plan to make my next pair in some beautiful plain linen.

This pattern is included in the _Make it Simple_ [Tilly and the Buttons](https://www.instagram.com/tillybuttons) book that I got for my birthday recently! I've never made a pair of trousers before (unless you count PJs) and due to the temperature getting warmer and the sun coming out I thought I should make some nice lightweight summer trousers.

The fabric used is a linen-cotton mix from [Pound Fabrics](https://poundfabrics.co.uk/) and it's absolutely perfect for lightweight summer clothes.

The trousers are incredibly simple to make and are comprised simply of a "front leg" and "back leg" pattern piece, with elastic pulling it all together at the waistband.

There were some extra instructions if you wanted to add pockets which were easy enough to follow. Saying that, I did have a couple of issues with finishing seams as I misinterpreted the first step to "overlock the side seams and outer edges of the 4 pockets", leaving the curved pocket edge unfinished and then having to go back later and try and finish it whilst everything was already sewn together. At least I know now! If you really look at the picture closely you can see that all the edges of the pockets are finished, but it's hard to tell this unless you really look, as it's such a small picture with white stitches on white fabric.

After I'd finished, my elastic kept shifting around my waist which was very irritating and looked bad. The pattern suggests sewing a line of zig-zag stitches through the centre of the elastic if this happens but I didn't want that to be visible all the way around. I opted for a couple of 2-3cm zig-zags on the left and right side of the back. This fixed the problem! Also, due to the elastic the pockets kind of awkwardly shift back but they are still very much usable.

I just have to add that this was my first time succeeding at pattern matching and I'm very proud of myself! <i class="bi bi-emoji-smile"></i>

Overall, the trousers turned out great and I can see myself wearing them a lot this summer. They are super comfy as well as stylish and are just the kind of thing I needed for hot days working from home.

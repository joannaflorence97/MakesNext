I’ve had my eye on the Lamour Dress for ages and finally decided to give it a go - and wow, she did not disappoint. I chose the bodice with the three-way halter strap paired with the sarong-style skirt, and I love how simply changing the way you tie the straps can completely transform the look of the dress! It feels like getting three dresses in one.

# Ease of Instructions

The instructions are really clear and thoughtfully laid out, with each step broken down alongside helpful illustrations. I also found a full video tutorial on YouTube where Gertie (the founder of Charm Patterns) walks through making the dress in great detail - an absolute lifesaver for the more complex parts, like piecing together the sarong skirt.Even though it’s technically an intermediate-level project, the guidance is detailed enough that a confident beginner could absolutely take it slow and manage it. I never felt lost thanks to all the extra support, and Charm Patterns' instruction booklets are some of the most thorough I’ve ever used.

# Sizing and Fit

I made a size 6 based on my measurements, and the fit was surprisingly good straight off the bat. One of the best things about Charm Patterns is that they offer multiple cup sizes - a total game-changer if you usually need to do a bust adjustment.I’d definitely recommend checking the finished garment measurements carefully and making a quick toile if you’re between sizes or have a longer/shorter torso. I made a basic toile out of an old bedsheet, and it gave me the confidence to dive straight into my final fabric without major changes.

# Final Thoughts

I love this pattern and already have plans to make another version - maybe with the bodice sash next time? The Lamour Dress is the perfect occasion dress: it feels glamorous, elegant, and vintage-inspired, but still wearable and fun.If you’re a fan of dramatic silhouettes, clever customisation options, and beautifully detailed instructions, the Lamour Dress is 100% worth your time.

# Key Points

1. Great fit: Cup sizes included for an easier, more tailored fit.
2. Clear instructions: Detailed booklet plus a full video tutorial.
3. Customisable: Mix-and-match bodices, skirts, and strap styles.

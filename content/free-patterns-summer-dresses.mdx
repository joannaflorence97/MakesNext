Sewing is an expensive hobby! Sometimes there are very high costs involved in buying fabric, tools, threads and of course a sewing machine. I like to grab a freebie where I can! Thatâ€™s why today Iâ€™m sharing seven different summer dress sewing patterns, all with free downloadable PDF patterns and instructions ðŸ‘—

I picked these dresses as they are all unique in their own way and I hope you like them. Theyâ€™re also all perfect for beginners. I have tonnes more free dress patterns hidden up my sleeve so let me know if youâ€™d like me to make a second video on this topic!

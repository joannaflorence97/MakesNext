Yet another gorgeous dress by [Tilly and the Buttons](https://www.instagram.com/tillybuttons). This one features a relaxed waist with a button up front and shirt collar. The different options for sleeve length and dress length mean that this dress can be turned into an easy-to-wear summer dress just as easily as it can be turned into a toasty winter dress.

The options I went for were:

1. The knee length variation.
2. The short sleeve variation.
3. The optional waist tie.

I accidentally cut the sleeves out at a length that was more 3/4 length than short sleeved. Although I could have chopped off a few inches to get down to the short sleeve length, I decided I quite liked the 3/4 length variation I'd created!

The fabric I used was kindly gifted to me by [Minerva](https://minerva.com) and is a beautifully soft 100% cotton that was a real pleasure to sew with. It basically glided through the machine and is perfect for Summer. I also lined the skirt was an old white bedsheet.

I'd never made a collar before but the instructions presented the instructions clearly with helpful images to follow along with. When I did get stuck I was able to refer to the Tilly and the Buttons website where there's a whole blogpost on making a neat shirt collar from basics. The pattern also gave me a chance to practice sewing neatly alligned buttonholes, something I hadn't done for a while either.

I took my time to make this dress and I think because of that it turned out to be the best item that I have made to date!

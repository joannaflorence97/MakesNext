    'A relaxed, zip-front dress with playful details and practical pockets that’s super wearable, despite being a step outside my usual style!',
  categories: ['Reviews', 'Patterns'],
};

The McCalls M8553 pattern is definitely a step outside my usual style. With its loose waistline, oversized patch pockets, and relaxed, oversized silhouette, it’s a far cry from the fitted, waist-cinching dresses I normally reach for. But after seeing zip-front dresses pop up all over my Instagram feed, I found myself getting more and more curious. So when Minerva offered me the opportunity to try out this pattern as part of their new kit, I thought - why not? And honestly, I’m so glad I did! It turns out, this style is not only incredibly comfortable, but surprisingly flattering too. I feel effortlessly put together when I wear it, and it’s the kind of dress you can throw on and instantly feel good in.

# Ease of Instructions

The construction of the dress came with a few challenges, but nothing too intimidating. The trickiest part by far was shortening the metal zipper and getting it to sit neatly at the front of the bodice. It took a bit of patience and careful measuring, but it was worth the effort for the clean finish - not to mention the adorable heart-shaped zipper pull, which adds such a fun and personal touch. I also had to be really mindful when attaching the patch pockets - I wanted them to be perfectly symmetrical, so there was a lot of pinning, re-pinning, and stepping back to check.

The instructions themselves were clear and easy to follow, which made the overall process feel quite smooth. That said, I probably wouldn’t recommend this pattern to complete beginners purely because of the zip construction - it requires a bit of precision and confidence to get it looking neat. However, for an adventurous beginner or anyone with a few makes under their belt, it’s a satisfying project with a great end result.

One of my favourite features of the pattern is the puffy sleeves. They give the dress a slightly more dramatic, playful feel and help balance out the relaxed fit of the bodice. I do wish I’d taken a little more time with the gathering when attaching the skirt to the bodice, as it’s not quite as even as I’d like, but it’s a minor detail in the grand scheme of things. The dress also includes two generous inseam pockets, which are such a practical addition - they're big enough to comfortably fit my phone, which is always a win!

# Sizing & fit

Because the dress has such a relaxed, oversized silhouette, I decided to skip making a toile and went straight in with a size 6 based on my measurements. I’m happy to say it fit just as expected. The sizing felt true to the pattern envelope, with plenty of ease built in for that comfortable, roomy fit. While I do enjoy the loose feel of the dress, I’m also thinking about making a simple belt from the leftover fabric to add a bit more shape when I want it. It’s nice to have that styling flexibility built into one piece!

# Final Thoughts

Sewing the M8553 has been such a refreshing change of pace. It pushed me slightly out of my comfort zone, both in terms of style and construction, but the result is a dress I genuinely love wearing. It’s easy to throw on, feels effortless, and still has enough detail to make it feel special. I’m already considering a second version - maybe in a bold print or lighter fabric for summer. If you're looking for a satisfying sew that results in a super wearable piece, I’d definitely recommend giving this pattern a go!
